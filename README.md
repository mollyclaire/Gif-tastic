# Unit 6 App - The Office Gif Generator 

## Motivation
I created this project as homework assignment #6 for UT Coding Bootcamp. I accessed the Giphy API in order to access the gifs used in the app. 

To view this game along with other projects, check out my portfolio: https://mollyclaire.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/

## Tech/Framework Used
- jQuery
- Bootstrap grid

## How To Use
First, click on one of the character buttons on the right side of the page. Ten gifs relating to that character should populate onto the page. Click the image to see the gif play, and click it again to stop the annimation. 

If you'd like to access gifs of other The Office characters, simply type that person's name into the text box. A new button with that character's name on it should appear on the right side of the page with the other buttons!
